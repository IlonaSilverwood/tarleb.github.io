Last night was the night of this year's MetaNook. It was the
fourth time that the local hackers, most notably [MetaMeute][] and
[Chaotikum][], joined forces to organize a night full of
beginner-friendly introductions, advanced tech talks, and project
presentations.

My [talk contribution][shell-talk] this year was a brief
introduction in the “magic” of the command-line. The talk slides
are adapted to the topic in that the presentation must be given
from the command line. Each slide is just a function, the whole
presentation environment is held together by scripts and other
shell-equivalences of duckt-tape. Feedback from the thirty or-so
attendees was mostly positive.

It was a very fun experience over all, as usual.
