  TL;DR: Set the website's `site-url` property to generate a
  `sitemap.xml` file.

Sitemaps are an easy way to list all pages that a search engine
should crawl and index. Quarto supports the standard, XML based
[Sitemap Protocol](https://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html),
although that fact is a bit hidden in the docs.

Quarto will automatically produce a sitemap if the website's URL
is given as `site-url` property:

```yaml
website:
  title: tarleb
  site-url: 'https://tarleb.com'
  site-path: '/'
```

The URL will contain a colon `:`, which is why the YAML value
must be put in quotes.

You'll find the `sitemap.xml` file in your `_site` folder after
re-rendering your pages with `quarto render`.
