  Do you build custom Docker images and need a recent pandoc version
  in there? It's as easy as
  `COPY --from=pandoc/minimal:2.19.2 /pandoc
  /usr/bin/pandoc`{style="white-space:unset"}

When pandoc is used in larger pipelines, e.g. in combination with
[Sphinx](https://sphinx-doc.org), it can be useful to pack
everything up into one neat container. One option is to base the
container on a pandoc image like `pandoc/core`, but this may be
difficult due to other dependencies. In this case, the easiest
option is to do this:

``` Dockerfile
COPY --from=pandoc/minimal:2.19.2 /pandoc /usr/bin/pandoc
```

The snippet, when added to a Dockerfile, copies a statically
compiled executable from an official build to `/usr/bin/pandoc`.
The static pandoc binary can run on all Linux distributions, so it
does not matter what distro the custom build is based on.

The documentation for the
<https://hub.docker.com/r/pandoc/minimal> has more info, including
a list of supported versions (tags).
