  An opinionated list of online materials that pandoc users may
  find useful.

These are the resources that I'd want to have if I was to learn
about [pandoc (the universal document
converter)](https://pandoc.org/) all over again:

## Installing

[latest release]
:   The GitHub release page has installers for Windows, macOS, and
    Linux.

[Docker images]
:   There are three types of pandoc Docker images:

    - [minimal] – very small, just the bare pandoc binary;
    - [core] – includes pandoc-crossref and helpers programs, e.g.
      those used by pandoc for SVG image conversion;
    - [latex][latex image] – like core, plus TeXLive with all
      packages required by the default template.

    These images can be used as an alternative to a system-wide
    installation. The image repository descriptions also explain
    how the images can be used.

[latest release]: https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/latest
[Docker images]: https://hub.docker.com/u/pandoc
[minimal]: https://hub.docker.com/r/pandoc/minimal
[core]: https://hub.docker.com/r/pandoc/core
[latex image]: https://hub.docker.com/r/pandoc/latex

## Documentation

[manual][]
:   The [official pandoc manual][manual]. When in doubt, this
    should always be the first resource to check. It covers all
    command line options, defaults files settings, format
    extensions, etc.

    Note that this always documents the latest pandoc version. If
    something isn't working as documented, you may need to update.

[FAQs](https://pandoc.org/faqs.html)
:   Frequently Asked Questions; click on the questions to see the
    answer.

[Wiki](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/wiki)
:   Pandoc's GitHub wiki; contains many additional resources,
    links, and tips.

[Lua filters][filters]
:   How to modify a document programmatically; also documents all
    constructors and utility functions exposed by pandoc.

[Custom reader][readers]
:   Interface that allows to write parsers for otherwise
    unsupported formats.

[Custom writers][writers]
:   Interface that allows to use pandoc to convert to a custom
    output format.

Format-specific documentation
:   The support for some formats is tune-able enough to warrant
    additional documentation.

## Getting help

Please make sure to search the web before posting.

[pandoc-discuss][]
:   Official pandoc mailing list; usually the best way to get
    help. The main developers and many seasoned users lurk here
    and answer questions.

    The web interface makes it seem like a Google account is
    required to post, but this isn't so: Write a mail to
    <mailto:pandoc-discuss+subscribe@googlegroups.com> to
    subscribe to the list with any mail address.

[StackOverflow][pandoc tag]
:   Post here to reach a more programming oriented group of
    people. Please *do not* cross-post, many people that follow
    the [pandoc tag] have also subscribed to the mailing list.

[TeX/LaTeX Stack Exchange](https://tex.stackexchange.com/)
:   This is a good place to ask for help when pandoc is used to
    generate PDFs via LaTeX. Be sure to include the (relevant
    parts) of the generated LaTeX output in your question, as most
    people there do not use pandoc. Some even seem to actively
    dislike it, so be prepared.
