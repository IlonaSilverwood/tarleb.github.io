  Control the document font with the `mainfont` variable. E.g., this
  will use a standard sans-serif TeX font: `mainfont: Latin Modern
  Sans`. Any system-wide font can be used when going via the XeLaTeX
  engine, i.e., when pandoc is called with `--pdf-engine=xelatex`.

Setting the document font this way works for ConTeXt, LaTeX, and
HTML output. The fonts used in docx or odt output must be
controlled with the reference document instead.

The default LaTeX engine is pdflatex, which only supports TeX's
own font format and cannot use the TrueType or OpenType fonts
installed on the system. However, XeLaTeX was written with that in
mind; switching to that engine allows to specify any font
available on the system.

A good source for free fonts is the [Google
Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) repository.
