I'm Albert, a molecular biologist turned mathematician turned
software engineer. I am interested in open source, with a special
passion for open science and publishing workflows. My main
involvement is with the universal document converter "pandoc",
where I'm a core developer.

I studied "molecular life science" and "mathematics in medicine
and life science"[^1] at the University of Lübeck, from where I
received a B.Sc. in the former and a M.Sc. in the latter.
Ironically, it was an enjoyable stint at the Max-Planck Institute
for Evolutionary Biology that led me more towards programming. I'm
working as a software engineer since 2012.

After spending time in Lübeck, Hamburg, and Menlo Park, I now
live in Berlin with my wife and kids.

[^1]: My diploma actually contains the old, less accurate name
      of that program, "computational life science".
